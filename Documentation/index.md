# Project documentation

SPADE is a tool that parses strings representing instances of discrete math type problems, for example NP complete problems. SPADE also makes sure that the instance of a problem follows the description of that problem. SPADE takes two things, a description of the problem known as the definition string, and the string representing a particular instance of that problem. SPADE then provides acces using a Utilcollections class.
